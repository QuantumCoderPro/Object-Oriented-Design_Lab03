Understanding Java Multithreading

This repository contains Java code examples that demonstrate the effective use of threads in Java applications. Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that allows concurrent execution of tasks, enabling better performance and responsiveness. The repository covers the following key aspects:


**1. Use of Threads in Java Applications:**

Responsive User Interface:  
Illustrates how threads can be employed to keep graphical user interfaces (GUIs) responsive while performing background tasks.

Parallel Processing:
Demonstrates the use of threads for parallel processing, improving the performance of CPU-bound operations.

Asynchronous Operations:
Shows how threads can be utilized for asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to run independently of the main program flow.

Multithreading in Servers:
Provides examples of using threads in server applications to handle multiple client requests concurrently.


**2. Java Thread Methods:**

start():
Initiates the execution of the thread asynchronously.

run():
Contains the code executed in the new thread.

sleep(long milliseconds):
Pauses the execution of the current thread for the specified duration.

join():
Waits for a thread to terminate.

interrupt():
Interrupts the thread, causing it to stop executing if it's in a blocked state.


**3. Thread Life Cycle in Java:**

New:
Thread is in this state before the start() method is called.

Runnable:
Thread is ready to run after the start() method is invoked.

Blocked/Waiting:
Thread waits for a resource or to enter a synchronized block/method.

Terminated:
Thread enters this state when its run() method completes or the stop() method is called.


**4. Creating Threads in Java:**

Extending Thread class:
Define a class that extends the Thread class and override the run() method.

Implementing Runnable interface:
Define a class that implements the Runnable interface and provides the implementation for the run() method.

Explore the examples to understand and apply multithreading concepts in Java. Comments in the code provide additional explanations for learners and developers.
